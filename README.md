# Feature-Net-Learn
The code of our paper "Who Spread to Whom? Inferring Online Social Networks with User Features" In 2018 IEEE International Conference on Communications(ICC) (2018).

The python code for a Multilayer perceptron neural network which aims to infer hidden network. The number of layers and perceptrons can be adjusted. A paper to be submitted is included. Files are listed as follows:

TrainingFeatureNetInf.py ------------------------- Modifying and training DNN model.

FNI.ckpt/FNI.ckpt.meta/checkpoint ---------------- Save files of the trained model.

FeatureNetInf.py --------------------------------- Loading DNN model for prediction task.
